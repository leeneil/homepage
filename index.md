During 2019 summer, Po-Nan interned at Google, where he worked with the [Daydream](https://vr.google.com/daydream/) team on VR/AR projects.

Prior to joining Stanford in 2015, Po-Nan worked on several computational physics and imaging projects with Dr. Ting-Kuo Lee, now an Academian, at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Born and bred in Taiwan, he received his master's and bachelor's degrees from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.

When not doing research, Po-Nan likes to explore the beautiful Bay Area by hiking and biking with his camera.
