My first paper with [Prof. T.K. Lee](https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~tkgroup/people.html). This work envisioned a novel experimental approach for the X-ray coherent diffraction that can greatly enhance the resolution of the reconstructed image. This paper provides an elegant mathematical proof of presented method, which is done by the first author [Ti-Yen Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiyenlan/) and simulation results as proof of concept.
